---EC2/S3 CLI instructions---
running
>>> aws s3 mb s3://[url name] 
!would make an S3 bucket!

to setup credentials run

>>> aws configure
!will need access key id and secret access key!

to see s3 buckets in current region

>>>aws s3 ls

to copy/upload file to s3 bucket

>>>aws s3 cp  [file] s3://[bucket-url]

to see and change credentials

>>>cd .aws
!this directory contains a credentials file!

can attach role to ec2 under actions->instance settings

using roles is more secure than using credentials to connect to ec2 from the CLI
