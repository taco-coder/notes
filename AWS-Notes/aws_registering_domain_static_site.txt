---Registering a domain name for a static site---
AWS uses route53 to register domains

make sure you have a bucket of the exact same name of the domain in S3

got to properties of the and set static website hosting to host a site and tell it the names of the index and error files

edit public access settings and uncheck 'block all public access' because we want people to be able to access our site

change bucket policy under bucket permissions to be public

add our index and error html files to our bucket

access should say public

once created, go into hosted zone and click 'create record set'

we can enable 'alias' and then select our appropriate S3 bucket under targets and then hit create

creates a serverless static site this way
