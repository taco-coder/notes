cloudfront is a content delivery network (CDN)

Edge locations act as caches for files that are stored at a different bucket in a different region to save time

first user gets latency to download the file from origin to cache

TTL (time to live) sets how long the file stays cached before being deleted from cache. usually 24-48 hours by default (in seconds)

web distribution-typically used for websites

takes time to create a distribution (about an hour)

connects to S3 buckets

origin path can be used if you want to use a specific folder in a bucket; leave empty if you want to use the whole bucket

under the distribution settings, you can invalidate specific files or file types so it no longer is put on the Edge Location cache if you want some objects to take priority
