---IAM Credential Report---
Shows when passwords are used
shows when access keys were made and last used

Go into IAM and you can download from tab 'credential report'

---IAM---
Under services->security

can create groups with appropriate permissions and add users to groups (best practice for cleaner management)

BEST PRACTICE: use root account to make IAM accounts for every user, even admin. Should not use root account for anything other than creating and managing user accounts

can enable MFA for root account; if you lose access to MFA app then you need to contact AWS support

Tons of different job functions and permissions for every type of user account

when granting programmatic access, you only see the credentials once so be sure to download the .csv not to lose the info

under policies, you can see the json notations of the policies 

can create password policy: length, special characters, reuse, and how often it needs to be updated

if Access key is lost for user, we can deactivate the old key and create a new key for them

can create Roles to allow one AWS service to use another AWS service ie allowing EC2 to have admin access to S3
