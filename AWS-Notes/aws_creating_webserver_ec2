---building a web server on ec2 instance---
1-get public ip

2-connect to instance

>>>yum install httpd (apache)

>>>service httpd start
starts apache service

/var/www/html is the root directory for the website
any files in the directory are visible when visiting the ip

under advanced details in configure instance step, can run a script to automate setup of instance on creation

---using an elastic load balancer---
scroll down to loadbalancers in ec2 side menu

can take 5-10 minutes to create

when using with ec2, pay attention to availability zone. if creating a second server, use a different AZ than the first

we can use the load balancer DNS to go to our webpage instead of the ec2 instance IP. If an instance goes down or reboots, we don't need to worry about the ip address

under the target groups settings we can add or remove instances to a load balancer

application load balancers-use for media content and applications; 7 layer OSI model 

network load balancers-extreme performance/static ip address
