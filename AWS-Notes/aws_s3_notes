S3 is for object files only

'buckets' are just folders where you can store files

bucket names are universal namespace so they have to be unique

Objects consist of
    Key: name of object
    value: the data that makes up the file
    version ID: version number of that file
    metadata: data about data in the file

can enable MFA to delete objects
