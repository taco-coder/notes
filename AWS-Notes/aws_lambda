---Lambda---
What is Lambda?
    Event driven compute service that can run code in response to events.
    Events could be changes to data in S3 buckets or DynamoDB table for example
    Runs in response with HTTP requests using AWS API or SDK
Architecture
    Traditional: hit loadbalancer then go to webservers then backend database. Always have resources running (expensive)
    Lambda: API gateway->lambda functions->Database (DynamoDB). Only runs resources when triggered (cheaper)
Pricing
    Requests: free for first million then $0.20 per 1 million requests after
    Duration/Execution time: Depends on amount of memory you allocate to your functions. Charged $0.00001667 for every GB/second used.
Version Control
    Lambda has version control integrated so you can rollback to previous versions of your code
What sets Lambda Apart?
    No servers
    Continuous/automatic scaling out
    Cheap
Lambda in Action
    Can be found in Alexa and Amazon Echo
